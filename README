MeasuringTape is a tool, that makes you able to simply figure out a distance, an area or even a track. MT uses a string to mark the positions. I once thought it would be just practically to measure how far my cannon shoot, but by now are there a few other purposes, like metering a base area and so on. The track mode can be used to measure the road between two cities. Roadsigns with the exact remaining distance in m look very nice.
String attaching is deactivatable to avoid conflicts with other plugins also using a string to mark blocks, e.g. WorldEdit.
MT can use the Permission Plugin but is not depending on it. If Permissions is deaktivated in config or doesn't run on the server MT will use some default right managemant: Measuring ant "/mt tape" are available for all and "/mt tp" only for ops.
